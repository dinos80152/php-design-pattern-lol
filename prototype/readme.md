# Prototype

* use an exist instance as a prototype.
* Copy an instance with the same preference.
* I don't know the class of the object but I can clone an object and use setters to customize my object.
* To create a familiar object, you don't have to initialize everything again.
* Sometime clone is effective than instantiate an object.
