# State

## Problem

* Context have to work differently depends on what state it is.
* In traditional, it's going a if/else hell.

## Roles

* Context
* State
* Concrete States

## Details

* Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.
* State vs Strategy
  * State changes context object behavior by itself.
  * Strategy changes context object behavior by client.
* Prepare a State Diagram for making design easily.
